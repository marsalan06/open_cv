images are array of boxes , in those array the color can be added by changing the value in the boxes , 
in gray scale these boxes can be filled witheither white 1 or 0 black, these array are termed as pixels,
vga=640x480 (width x height), HD= 1280 x 1080, FHD=1920x1080 , 4k=3840x2160

A black and white image is called binary image, so we use an 2^8=256 value to make this an analog structure,
for color we have RGB (0,0,0) to (255,255,255) so a color vga image is 640 x 480x 3,

after installation we'll get the opencv package, and start our project, disable pylance from ctrl+shift+p
if import error exists,  to read image use imread in a variable, and to show its imshow with waitkey(0)
where 0 is infinte while 1s == 1000 and so on 

for video its VideoCapture() and has a boolean confirmation at imshow, set (3) for height, set(4) for width
and set(10) for brightness, for mirror issue use cv.flip(img,1),1 for horizontle flip and 0 for vertical flip

to convert to grayscale , cvtcolor(img,BGR2GRAY) method is used in BGR2GRAY
to blur it, cv.GaussianBlur(img,(ksize),sigmaX) 

Edge detector , we will use cv.Canny(img,100,100) where 100 and 100 are Edge intensity and linkages, these
can be diffrent as per need,
